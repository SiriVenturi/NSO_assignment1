Small-Medium Business Network Design and Implementation:

This project entails the design, implementation, and testing of a robust network infrastructure for a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) encompassing three primary departments: Engineering, Sales, and Management. The network architecture has been planned with both current operational needs and future expansion in mind, incorporating essential elements such as scalability, resiliency, and efficient monitoring. Key highlights of the project include:

- Departmental Subnets: Creation of distinct subnets for Engineering, Sales, and Management, further subdivided to accommodate specific operational groups within each department.
- Scalable Engineering Infrastructure: Setup of 300 computers in the Engineering department, including 40 production servers deployed in Service Production Units (SPUs) with hot-swap load balancing to ensure high availability and load distribution.
- Sales and VPN Integration: Network configuration to support 10 back-office sales staff and 20 remote salespeople using VPN connections, with an SPU deployment for VPN servers to ensure reliable remote access.
- Management Network: Provision of secure and efficient network resources for a small management team of five people.
- Shared Resources: Deployment of 10 shared printers and 2 file servers accessible to Sales and Management departments.
- Future-Proof Design: Accommodation for anticipated growth, including additional staff and new services (I and J), with provisions for seamless integration of acquired networks.
- Comprehensive Monitoring: Implementation of a monitoring solution to track link status and utilization with 5-minute averages, and more frequent 10-second intervals for critical SPU components.
- Testing and Validation: Extensive testing to ensure full connectivity and resilience, including the ability to integrate and communicate with an additional network representing future acquisitions.
